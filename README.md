# FE8 Nightmare Modules : Light & Lighter Editions
This is a small collection of FE8 Nightmare Modules for use with the buildfile method. They were simplified, clarified and corrected compared to their original counterpart.

My goal here is to only include modules for tables that are not easily and/or conveniently able to be edited through the buildfile method.

[For more information on how to use the buildfile method to build a GBAFE hack, check this guide.](https://stackedit.io/viewer#!provider=gist&gistId=084645b0690253600f4aa2a57b76a105&filename=feutv2)

# Light Package
The Light Package contains the complete modules for Chapter Data, Characters, Classes and Items, (hopefully) in a fully working state.

# Lighter Package
The Lighter Package contains only the Characters, Classes and Item modules, and those module contains *only* entries for stats, this is for people like me that like to do as much as possible through event files.

The Lighter Package is best used with libraries like [BOOTS](https://github.com/StanHash/BOOTS).
