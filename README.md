# FE8 Nightmare Modules : Light & Lighter Editions
This is a small collection of FE8 Nightmare Modules for use with the buildfile method. They were simplified, clarified and corrected compared to their original counterpart.

My goal here is to only include modules for tables that are not easily and/or conveniently able to be edited through the buildfile method. This includes tables for Items/Characters/Class but excludes tables for like Pointer Arrays (let alone the "tables" for crit bonus and whatnot).

[For more information on how to use the buildfile method to build a GBAFE hack, check this guide.](https://stackedit.io/viewer#!provider=gist&gistId=084645b0690253600f4aa2a57b76a105&filename=feutv2)

# Included CSVs

The CSV Included here are provided with pre-filled fields that make use of definitions taken from [BOOTS](https://github.com/StanHash/BOOTS). As long as you use the definitions included with this and/or BOOTS, the csv should represent the vanilla tables, but in a more readable format.

# I found an error/I want another Table

If you found an error and know how to github, you can pull request a fix right away.

If you have suggestions about other tables that should be included, feel free to ping me on the FEU Topic or the FEU Discord.
